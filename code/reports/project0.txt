We need 3 paragraphs for the following -
a) Your experience installing Nachos w/ platform details
b) your experience w/ the tests
c) A description of the Thread class

1 paragraph for each of the 3 requirements above, i figure we can use this google doc to work on all 3 topics above together then copy paste it VIM and upload to server per instructions.

Downloading the Nachos v3.4 source code and compiler was accomplished using wget and URL provided. 
The file was downloaded to the current directory in the nachos server. 
Next, nachos was compiled using the make command. 
No issues were encountered with the environment variables and the compilation was successful. 

The test programs were located at the specified directories and executed using ./nachos -x and 
path of the halt program. The second test involved executing halt program with -s parameters,
which steps through the execution in debugging mode. 
Once finished, the output of the halt program printed statistics including number of ticks, 
disk I/O reads/writes, console I/O read/writes, paging faults, and network I/O packages sent/received.  
The halt program includes a method Halt() found in syscall.h which shutdowns the nachos operating system. 
While executing in debug mode (-s parameters specified), the output displayed on the terminal showed each 
of the machine registers including the program counter. 

Finally, the Thread class was analyzed. The thread class includes very important method calls, including 
the ability to initialize a thread control block, fork a process, finish processes once a thread is done 
executing the forked procedure, sleep or relinquish CPU while waiting for a synchronization variable, 
including Semaphore, lock or condition.
