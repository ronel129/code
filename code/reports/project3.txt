Our team successfully added to nachos the ability to perform the following file system calls: Create, Open, Read, Write, and Close.
This project relied heavily on the code for Project 2 and felt more like a continuation, rather than its own separate project. 
Just like we did for Project 2, we added a handler for each of the required system calls in userprog/exception.cc. 
Like in the previous project, the exception handler of nachos would then determine which system call the 
process was trying to execute and call the corresponding handler. We added a ‘strcmp’ method that accepts two 
char pointers for string comparison in ‘utilities.cc’. This method is utilized by methods in ‘userprog/sysopenfile.cc’.
Sysopenfile.cc contains numerous file manipulation methods such as SysOpenFile::closeFile, SysOpenFile::closeAll, 
SysOpenFileManager::Add, SysOpenFileManager::Get, and SysOpenFileManager::closeFile. 
All system open files are kept in the ‘sysOpenFileObjects’ array. In ‘threads/system.cc’, we have a SpecialRead 
and SpecialWrite methods. SpecialRead accepts a virtual address, buffer pointer, and buffer size and 
writes the data read from an Open File into the buffer. The SpecialWrite method also takes a virtual address buffer pointer 
and buffer size, and outputs the buffer data into an Open File. 

In order to execute and test this project we have copied the TA provided user program test files ‘cp.c’, 
‘concurrentRead.c’, and ‘in.dat’ to the test directory of nachos. 

We had to change a line in cp.c from src = Open("in.dat"); to src = Open("../test/in.dat");

To execute, first navigate to the userprog nachos directory and follow the inputs provided below.
